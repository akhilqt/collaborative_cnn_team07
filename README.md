# Collaborative CNN for Animal Classification

This repository implements a collaborative image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in PyTorch.

## Team & Datasets

Each user trains a separate CNN model on their own dataset, and then we cross-test the models on the *other* dataset without sharing any raw images.

## Folder Structure

```text
collaborative_cnn_animals/
  models/      # model definitions (.py) and saved weights (.pth)
  notebooks/   # Jupyter notebooks for training and testing
  results/     # JSON metrics and logs
  utils/       # helper scripts (metrics, data loaders, etc.)
  data/        # local datasets (ignored by git)



## Future Work

More details about models, training, and results will be added as the project evolves.
