# Collaborative CNN Project

This repository contains the final code and results for a two-user CNN classification project.  
The goal is to demonstrate correct GitHub collaboration using **forks, branches, pull requests, issues** and **cross-evaluation** of models trained on different datasets.

---

## 1. GitHub Workflow (Required Deliverables)

### • Base Repository (User 1)
https://github.com/Saikat-rpr/cnn1

### • User 2 Fork
https://github.com/akhilqt/cnn1

### • Pull Request #1 (User 1 → main)
https://github.com/Saikat-rpr/cnn1/pull/1

### • Pull Request #2 (User 2 → main)
https://github.com/Saikat-rpr/cnn1/pull/2

These links show the full collaborative workflow.

Grad-CAM visualizations for both models are available in:
  - `results/gradcam_v1_animals/`
  - `results/gradcam_v2/`

## 2. Tasks Completed by Each User

### **User 1**
- Created the main repository  
- Implemented and trained **model_v1** on the Animals dataset  
- Logged results and metrics  
- Evaluated User 2’s model on User 1 dataset  
- Merged PRs and finalized the repository structure  

### **User 2**
- Forked the base repo  
- Worked on branch `dev_user2`  
- Implemented and trained **model_v2** on PlantVillage dataset  
- Logged metrics and opened PR #2  
- Reported cross-testing results through a GitHub Issue
